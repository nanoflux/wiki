<p>You have multiple networks, but you later decided, that you want them as one without manually breaking and replacing all components?<br><br>You can use the <code>/net merge &lt;net1&gt; &lt;net2&gt;</code> command.</p>
<p>This will merge net2 into net1.</p>
<p>The final network will have the name of net1, the components of both and the higher upgrade tier from both.</p>
<p><br>In order to use it, you need to be owner of both networks. If you want to merge your network with one of your friend, one of you needs to<a href="/en/users"> transfer the network's ownership</a> to the other.</p>
