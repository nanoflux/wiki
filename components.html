<p>At the moment there are 3 Types of components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input containers - Items in these chests will automatically get transferred into the miscellaneous chests.</li>
  <li>Sorting containers - These chests have an item as a filter and only items matching the chest's filter will get transferred here</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous containers - If there is no chest for an item type, the leftover items will go here</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add a component into your network, you first need to craft it at the crafting table.</p>
<p>The recipes should be unlocked at join, make sure the recipe book is set to “Show all” and not “Only craftable”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After <a href="/en/basics">selecting the network</a>, the components should be installed in, just place down the component you crafted.</p>
<p>You should receive a confirmation message in chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further editing, you need a <strong>Network Wand</strong>, which can also be crafted.</p>
<p>Using left-click (without shift), you can switch between filter editing and priority editing mode.</p>
<p>By right-clicking on a network component, you can see basic information about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Sorting Containers to function, they need to be given at least one item as a filter.</p>
<p>This is done by shift + right-clicking a Sorting Container with a <strong>Network Wand</strong> on <strong>Filter Mode</strong> in the main hand and your filter item in the offhand.<br>To remove the filter, do the same, but shift + left click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have multiple sorting containers with the same filter or multiple miscellaneous containers, you can set their priority, so that higher priority components will be filled first.</p>
<p>(Sorting containers are ALWAYS prioritized over Miscellaneous containers)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change a component's priority, make sure your wand is set to <strong>Priority Mode</strong> and shift + right/left click on a Sorting/Miscellaneous container.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
