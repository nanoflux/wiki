<p>Without any other plugins, ALL players can open your network's chests and take items out of it.</p>
<p>If you wish that only certain player are able to access them, just use any other claim plugin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, only the network owner can break components and add new ones.</p>
<p>To give other players access to editing your network, add them using <code>/net user add &lt;player&gt;</code></p>
<p>In case you want to revoke their access, use <code>/net user remove &lt;player&gt;</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to transfer the ownership of a network (For example if you want to merge two networks owned by different players), you can use <code>/net owner &lt;player&gt;</code></p>
