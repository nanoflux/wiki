<p>To create a storage network, simply run <code>/net create &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the ID of your network, you will need it to edit your network.</p>
<p>Every network on the server has its own unique ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To perform any changes, you first need to select your network using <code>/net select &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>This is needed to place new network components or add new users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to delete your network, simply run <code>/net delete &lt;name&gt;</code></p>
<p>You will be asked to confirm this action using <code>/net delete &lt;name&gt; confirm</code></p>
<p><strong>But be careful: This action is not reversible!</strong></p>
