<p>Networks is a minecraft plugin for Paper, that allows you to create fully automatic sorting systems easily.</p>
<p>You can define input containers, set filters to sorting containers and let unrecognized items flow into miscellaneous containers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes it much more performant and easier than regular redstone based sorting systems, while still staying vanilla style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the plugin at <a href="https://modrinth.com/plugin/networks">Modrinth</a> or <a href="https://hangar.papermc.io/Quantum625/Networks">Hangar</a></p>
